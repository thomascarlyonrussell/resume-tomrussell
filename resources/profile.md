PG&E Electric Distribution Resource
Plan

With a passion for creating innovative software solutions that

streamline engineering tasks, I've dedicated my career to driving the

future of power grid technologies. As a Product Manager at Integral

Analytics, I shape tools that empower engineers and analysts to

evaluate the cost-effective integration of sustainable energy into the

grid. My role focuses on merging advanced analytics with long-term

forecasting to enhance utility decision-making.

I began my career as a distribution engineer with a strong foundation

in power systems. My self-taught expertise in computer science,

combined with hands-on experience at a major utility, gives me a

unique perspective on technology-driven solutions for the energy

sector. At PG&E, I led efforts in integrated distribution planning,

spearheading the development of tools and standards that set new

baselines for hosting capacity analysis across California and the U.S.

I strive to lead by example and learn as much about not just what

to do but how to do it. I’m driven by a commitment to challenge the

status quo, streamline workflows, and deliver products that move

utilities forward, enhancing their processes and capabilities for a

sustainable energy future.
