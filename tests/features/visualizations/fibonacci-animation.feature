Feature: Fibonacci Animation
  As a visitor
  I want smooth animations in the Fibonacci view
  So that I have an engaging visual experience

  Scenario: Initial load
    Given the user scrolls to the visualization section
    When Fibonacci view loads
    Then skills animate into the spiral formation
    And animation respects user's motion preferences
