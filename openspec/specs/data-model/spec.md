# Data Model Specification

## Purpose

Define the data structures for skills, experience, and career information that power both visualizations and the AI chatbot knowledge base.

## Overview

A unified data model serves multiple purposes:
1. **Fibonacci Visualization** - Skills sized by intensity/proficiency
2. **Timeline Visualization** - Skills/categories building over time
3. **Chatbot Knowledge** - Structured information for AI responses

The same underlying data powers all three, ensuring consistency.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Skill Item Structure

Each skill item SHALL contain only static reference properties:

### Requirement: Fibonacci Sizing

For the Fibonacci visualization, skills SHALL be sized based on a calculated value from the Fibonacci sequence [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89].

The sizing algorithm SHALL calculate display size as:
```
size = proficiency × weighted_years × degradation_factor
```

Where:

- `weighted_years` = `(years_of_experience) × (proficiency / 8)`
- `years_of_experience` = Time from startDate to endDate (or present)
- `degradation_factor` = 1.0 if current OR <2 years since endDate, 0.5 if 2-5 years since endDate, 0.25 if >5 years since endDate

The algorithm SHALL:
- Group skills by category for color coding
- Position skills along a spiral based on category and calculated size
- Map the calculated size to the nearest Fibonacci value in [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] for final display

#### Scenario: High proficiency active skill
- **GIVEN** a skill with proficiency 8 and 10 years of experience (current)

- **AND** it appears smaller due to degradation

---

### Requirement: Timeline Aggregation

For the Timeline visualization, data SHALL aggregate by category over time.

The aggregation SHALL:

The proficiency calculation SHALL be:
```
proficiency = (sum(experience_proficiency × experience_duration) / total_duration) × degradation_factor
```

Where:
- `experience_proficiency` = Proficiency level for that skill in each experience
- `experience_duration` = Duration in months for each experience
- `total_duration` = Sum of all experience durations (in months)
- `degradation_factor` = 1.0 if currently active OR <2 years since last use, 0.5 if 2-5 years since last use, 0.25 if >5 years since last use

#### Scenario: Skill timeline computation
- **GIVEN** a skill "Python" used in 3 experiences spanning 2015-2025
- **WHEN** computing the skill's timeline
- **THEN** startDate is 2015-01
- **AND** endDate is null (current)
- **AND** isActive is true

#### Scenario: Skill proficiency computation with weighted average
- **GIVEN** a skill "SQL" used in experience A (2014-2018, 48 months, proficiency 3) and experience B (2018-present, 84 months, proficiency 5)
- **WHEN** computing current proficiency
- **THEN** proficiency = ((3 × 48) + (5 × 84)) / (48 + 84) × 1.0 = (144 + 420) / 132 × 1.0 = 4.27
- **AND** degradation_factor is 1.0 (currently active)

#### Scenario: Skill proficiency with inactive degradation
- **GIVEN** a skill "Cymdist" used in experience A (2014-2020, 72 months, proficiency 5)
- **AND** not used since 2020 (>5 years ago as of 2025)
- **WHEN** computing current proficiency
- **THEN** base_proficiency = 5
- **AND** degradation_factor is 0.25 (>5 years inactive)
- **AND** effective_proficiency = 5 × 0.25 = 1.25

#### Scenario: Skill proficiency growth over three experiences
- **GIVEN** a skill "Python" used in:
  - Experience A: 2015-2017, 24 months, proficiency 3
  - Experience B: 2017-2020, 36 months, proficiency 5
  - Experience C: 2020-present, 60 months, proficiency 8

- **THEN** weighted_proficiency = ((3 × 24) + (5 × 36) + (8 × 60)) / (24 + 36 + 60)
- **AND** weighted_proficiency = (72 + 180 + 480) / 120 = 732 / 120 = 6.1
- **AND** degradation_factor is 1.0 (currently active)
- **AND** effective_proficiency = 6.1 × 1.0 = 6.1
- **AND** this reflects skill growth from beginner (3) to expert (8) over 10 years

#### Scenario: Skill with no experiences
- **GIVEN** a skill that is defined but not referenced by any experience
- **WHEN** computing timeline properties
- **THEN** startDate and endDate are undefined
- **AND** isActive is false
- **AND** proficiency is undefined

---

### Requirement: Fibonacci Sizing with Derived Data

For the Fibonacci visualization, skills SHALL be sized based on computed properties derived from experiences.

The sizing algorithm SHALL calculate display size as:
```
size = proficiency × weighted_years
```

Where:
- `proficiency` = Weighted average proficiency from experiences (already includes degradation_factor)
- `weighted_years` = `(years_of_experience) × (proficiency / 8)`
- `years_of_experience` = Time from earliest experience startDate to latest experience endDate (or present)

Note: The `proficiency` value already incorporates the degradation factor as defined in the "Computed Skill Properties" requirement, so no additional degradation is applied at this stage.

#### Scenario: Skill sizing with multiple experiences
- **GIVEN** a skill "Python" with:
  - Experience A: 2015-2019, 48 months, proficiency 5
  - Experience B: 2019-present, 72 months, proficiency 8
- **WHEN** computing Fibonacci size
- **THEN** base_proficiency = ((5 × 48) + (8 × 72)) / (48 + 72) = (240 + 576) / 120 = 6.8
- **AND** degradation_factor is 1.0 (currently active)
- **AND** proficiency = 6.8 × 1.0 = 6.8
- **AND** years_of_experience is ~10 (2015 to present)
- **AND** weighted_years = 10 × (6.8 / 8) = 8.5
- **AND** calculated size = 6.8 × 8.5 = 57.8, mapped to Fibonacci 55

#### Scenario: Skill sizing with gap in usage
- **GIVEN** a skill "Microsoft Access" with:
  - Experience A: 2012-2015, 36 months, proficiency 3
  - No subsequent usage, ended 2015 (10 years ago as of 2025)
- **WHEN** computing Fibonacci size in 2025
- **THEN** base_proficiency = 3
- **AND** degradation_factor is 0.25 (>5 years inactive)
- **AND** proficiency = 3 × 0.25 = 0.75
- **AND** years_of_experience is ~3
- **AND** weighted_years = 3 × (0.75 / 8) = 0.28
- **AND** calculated size = 0.75 × 0.28 = 0.21, mapped to Fibonacci 1
- **AND** calculated size is significantly reduced

---

### Requirement: Timeline Aggregation with Experience-Based Data

For the Timeline visualization, data SHALL aggregate skills by category over time using experience date ranges.

The aggregation SHALL:
- For each time point, count skills active in experiences during that period
- Weight by proficiency level if desired
- Group by category for stacked display
- Support hover to show specific skills and their experiences at a point in time

#### Scenario: Category growth over time
- **GIVEN** multiple experiences adding "software-development" skills over time
- **WHEN** viewed on timeline from 2015-2025
- **THEN** the area shows growth as new skills were added through new experiences
- **AND** skills remain active as long as any experience is active

#### Scenario: Skill proficiency evolution
- **GIVEN** a skill "Python" growing from proficiency 3 to 8 across experiences
- **WHEN** hovering over timeline at different points
- **THEN** the tooltip shows the proficiency level at that time based on the active experience
